    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is JJ Wise, I am a senior at Jackson High School in Everett, Washington. I am also in my second year at Sno-Isle Technical Skill Center. 
      Sometimes events happen that make a lasting impact on your life, last spring I experienced оne of those events. I was involved in a serious automobile accident.
      Recovery has taken months. But that time has given me time to think. I realized how quickly life could change. I have decided not to take my future for granted. 
      I am determined to have a career that I enjoy and use all my skills and abilities, оne that provides room for professional and personal growth.</p>
    <p>Ever since elementary I've wanted to be a game designer. It seemed fun and I'd be able to do what I love . When I was in 5th grade I joined the robotics club at school. 
      That was my first exposure to coding and I loved it.  The ability to turn code to action was fascinating. After that I forgot about coding until my junior year in high school. 
      I signed up for Video Game design at Sno isle and from there I started to perfect my skills in coding and teamwork.</p>
    <p>In Sno isle I learned how to be a team leader and manage my time and my team. I work really well with others and I make sure that everyone is heard. 
      I'm really good at adapting to stressful situations and I'm able to learn really fast. Getting the things I need done on time is a number one priority because I never want to let my team down. </p>
